# Roadmap

WalletNow is currently under active development, and more features are added every week!

We maintain a [public list of feature requests on GitHub](https://github.com/wallet-now/wallet-now/issues), and we tag those which are planning to implement next, so you always know what to expect next!

Our next steps are:

1. Grab more feedback from the community to ensure it fits the most demanding power users
2. Launch the "WalletNow Membership", which will grant access to the more advanced features by simply holding $WNOW tokens on your wallet
3. Continue on "**BUIDLING**" and improving - always!
