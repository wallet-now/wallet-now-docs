# Time Machine

WalletNow **Time Machine** allows you to select a point in time and view your portfolio as if you were looking at it in the past. You can even see all the internal token details, and all exchange rates from that time!

You can also read more about this cool feature on our medium article: [https://walletnow.medium.com/introducing-walletnow-time-machine-a94172d3be3a](https://walletnow.medium.com/introducing-walletnow-time-machine-a94172d3be3a)

To use this feature:

* Click on "Time Machine" ðŸ—“
* Select a date from the list and then select a time from that date
* That is it! WalletNow will load a "snapshot" of your portfolio from that point in time. You can expand all investments normally to check all the details, change the local currency and see the summarized totals.

### How does it work? <a id="1f34"></a>

Every time that an eligible wallet data is verified \(by accessing it via the web interface or from Telegram\), WalletNow will transparently store the necessary metadata to reconstruct that data in the future. These "points in time" will be automatically available for you to query later in the Time Machine.

At this time, this metadata is stored for three months. Which means you can check for up to 90 days in the past using Time Machine \(after you start using WalletNow\).

Tip: When you combine this feature with our [**Active Monitoring**](active-monitoring.md), your personal robot assistant will automatically take a snapshot of your wallet every hour, which means you can select from at least 24 different points in time per day!!!

### Is my data safe? <a id="2c6f"></a>

Absolutely! At WalletNow we take data security very seriously. Our team has more than 10 years of experience in handling critical enterprise-scale cloud infrastructure security, and we value your privacy.

All stored data is encrypted using **256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES-256\)**, which helps secure your data from unauthorized access to the underlying storage.

Access to the data is restricted using state-of-the art technology managed by the world's lead cloud provider, and all our security credentials follow the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), along with Preventative Security Best Practices and Detective Security Best Practices.

### What about privacy? <a id="8ca0"></a>

We only use the stored data to provide you our cool features. No data is ever sold nor used for any additional purpose. We value your privacy!

We all know that data in the blockchain is public for anyone to read. Most of the time, if you share your public wallet address, anyone is able to see what is in there.

By default, this is also the case for WalletNow: All you need is the address of an account to see all the investments on that account. This default behavior is very convenient since you can just bookmark a link to your account and check it anywhere: On your laptop, on your mobile, on any computer with internet access, etc.

However, we also understand that, even though all data is public, WalletNow aggregates this data in a format that makes it super-easy to consume by anyone, and this may be a privacy concern.

To protect your data even if someone gets hold of your wallet address, you can enable our [privacy lock](privacy-lock.md) on Account Settings:

When you enable this feature, only the wallet owner is authorized to see the account data. You will need to login with your wallet, by signing a message \(at no cost â€” this signature happens offline\), which proves that you are the owner of that wallet. Read more about the login process [here](login.md).
