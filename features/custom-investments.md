# Custom Investments

Isn't it frustrating when you want to make an investment but your favorite aggregator does not support that protocol? You now have a dilema: Make the investment and keep track of it offline \(typically in a spreadsheet\) or skip the investment just because you want to have a consolidated vision of your crypto.

With **Wallet Now**, you don't need to worry about that! Just register a custom investment describing which token you are investing and how much of it, and Wallet Now will include that information consolidated in a single vision! Any BEP20 token is supported \(even LP Tokens\)!

If you make an investment which does not have a corresponding BEP20 token \(for example if that is on another chain\), you can always register your investment in USD to have some level of visibility about the external investment. Sometimes it is better to have a slightly outdated exchange rate and see that consolidated with all your other crypto than not having anything at all!

To register a custom investment, just open your Account Settings and add them there.

### Limitations

There are some important limitations with custom investments:

1. We don't know how much the investment is yielding \(or losing\), so the reported data is based exclusively on the amount of tokens invested and the current price of the token.
2. We support only BEP20 tokens \(all Binance Smart Chain tokens\). If there is no corresponding token in the BSC, you will need to register with a similar token or in Dollars.
