# Login

To modify any settings on your account, you will need to **Login** using your wallet.

The login process is very simple: We will request a message signature which you need to accept with your wallet application. This message signature happens completely offline, so **there is no cost for that**.

Once the message is successfully signed, we will store that information on your browser and use it to sign all the requests. This will enable you to modify your settings.

We currently support only MetaMask for the login process, but support for many more wallet applications is coming soon!

If you wish to logout for any reason, you can do so in the same page:

You can also configure your account to be visible only when logged-in. Read more about it [**here**](privacy-lock.md).
