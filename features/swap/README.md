# Swap

WalletNow has a builtin multi-chain liquidity aggregator to find the **best deal to swap your tokens**!

Before you start, make sure you have opened your wallet on WalletNow by entering its address on the landing page: [https://walletnow.net](https://walletnow.net)

To swap tokens on WalletNow, just click on any token that you want to swap and then click on the Swap button:

This will open the token Swap dialog, where you can select the output token:

Once you click on "Review Swap", WalletNow will search several liquidity sources to find the best deal for your swap:

The first time you swap a token, you may need to enable the token for swapping on WalletNow:

Once you submit the swap transaction, you can choose to wait for the confirmation or continue the transaction in the background:

Once the transaction is confirmed, you have successfully swapped your tokens!
