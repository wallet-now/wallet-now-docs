# Token ignore list

On WalletNow you can quickly ignore any token that you would like, without having to spend gas to "burn" them. You can do that in a few locations.

### In the token details:

When ignoring the token here, you can also report it as a SCAM token, so the team will very it and block it globally for all WalletNow users.
