# Active Monitoring

Your [Telegram Bot](telegram-bot.md) comes with another super-useful feature: Active Monitoring of all your tokens!

When you enable active monitoring, you will be automatically notified if there is any abnormal volatility in any of your investments \(any tokens you are currently holding or are locked in an investment\).
