# Multiple Wallets

Would you like to split your investments across multiple wallets for extra security, but still monitor them all in a consolidated view? We too!

With Wallet Now, you can register up to **five wallets per account**, and see all of them in a consolidated view in both the website and the Telegram Bot!

To register additional wallets, open "Account Settings" and add them. You can also manage those using the [Telegram Bot](telegram-bot.md).

Wallet Now is **free forever**. It will always have a free plan available for you to use - period!

To cover for the infrastructure and development costs we will offer paid plans in the future to unlock some of the most advanced features. **Right now, all features are 100% free to use, so go ahead and enjoy them.**
