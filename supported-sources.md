Would you like to request support for a new protocol? You can open a request [here](https://github.com/wallet-now/wallet-now/issues/new/choose). If you are the owner/leader of a protocol and you can provide technical details about the integration, it will greatly speed-up the process, otherwise it will be put in a queue for prioritization. You can also offer bounties for feature requests, which is a great way to incentivize the development team to prioritize. Read more about it **here**!
