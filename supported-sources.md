### **Under consideration \(no ETA\):**

\*\*\*\*[**https://github.com/wallet-now/wallet-now/labels/integration**](https://github.com/wallet-now/wallet-now/labels/integration)\*\*\*\*

Would you like to request support for a new protocol? You can open a request [**here**](https://github.com/wallet-now/wallet-now/issues/new/choose). If you are the owner/leader of a protocol and you can provide technical details about the integration, it will greatly speed-up the process, otherwise it will be put in a queue for prioritization.
