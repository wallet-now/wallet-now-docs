WalletNow is **free forever**. It will always have a free plan available for you to use - period!

However, to cover for the infrastructure and development costs, we also offer our SILVER and GOLD plans, which unlock our most advanced features.

### How do I upgrade my plan?

On your account, click on the "medal" üèÖ icon, and a popup similar to this will be displayed:

### WalletNow Membership <a id="e44b"></a>

To leverage all WalletNow features, you need to buy and hold [**$WNOW**](wnow-tokenomics.md) tokens on BSC. You can also add liquidity in any of our supported DEXes for additional benefits \(10% bonus\).

Our membership plans are:

* **Free:** Free forever! Basic functionality available to everyone.
* **Silver:** Every $1 worth of **$WNOW** held allows monitoring up to $300 of portfolio.
* **Gold:** Every $1 worth of **$WNOW** allows monitoring up to $200 of portfolio without any limitations.
* Users receive a bonus of 10% on their monitored amount by holding WNOW LP tokens from any of our supported DEXes \(we recommend BNB-WNOW on PancakeSwap\).
