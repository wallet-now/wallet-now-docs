WalletNow is **free forever**. It will always have a free plan available for you to use - period!

However, to cover for the infrastructure and development costs, we also offer our SILVER, GOLD and DIAMOND plans, which unlock our most advanced features.

#### Disclaimer

Keep in mind that $WNOW is a **utility token**, with the sole purpose of enabling your WalletNow membership plan. It should not be treated as a security nor an asset. We don‚Äôt promise any positive returns on $WNOW token purchases. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

#### Portfolio Calculation mechanism

All investments supported by WalletNow count towards your "portfolio amount". Including, but not limited to:

* Token holdings on your wallet
* Liquidity Provider tokens
* Tokens invested on any protocol
* Borrows and Lends on lending protocols \(both borrows and lends count positively\)

For token holdings on your wallet, each individual token is limited to a maximum of $100 USD. So even if you have 1 million dollars worth of Bitcoin sitting on your wallet, it still counts as only $100.
