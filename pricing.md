Keep in mind that $WNOW is a **utility token**, with the sole purpose of enabling your WalletNow membership plan. It should not be treated as a security nor an asset. We don‚Äôt promise any positive returns on $WNOW token purchases. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, so DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

### Membership Calculation mechanism

All investments supported by WalletNow count towards your "portfolio amount". Including, but not limited to:

* Token holdings on your wallet
* Liquidity Provider tokens
* Tokens invested on any protocol
* Borrows and Lends on lending protocols \(both borrows and lends count positively\)

The following exceptions are applied to the portfolio amount:

* For token holdings on your wallet, each individual token is limited to a maximum of $100 USD. So even if you have 1 million dollars worth of Bitcoin sitting on your wallet, it still counts as only $100
* Holding $WNOW does not count towards your portfolio

Once your portfolio amount is determined, we check how much $WNOW you own:

* $WNOW held in the wallet
* $WNOW LP tokens from any supported DEX
* $WNOW or LP invested on any protocol

**However, it is important to highlight that only the $WNOW owned by your primary wallet counts towards the membership. Secondary wallets count towards your portfolio amount but do not count for the WNOW membership.**

Then, it is only a matter of comparing the amount of WNOW owned vs your portfolio size to determine the active membership tier.
