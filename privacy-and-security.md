# Privacy and security

At WalletNow we take great care of our data. Our team has more than 10 years of experience in handling critical enterprise-scale cloud infrastructure security, and we value your privacy.

This page details the most important aspects of our data handling policies.

### Data security

All data is encrypted both in-transit and at-rest using **256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES-256\)**, which helps secure your data from unauthorized access to the underlying storage.

### What data is stored?

We only store data that is critical to the functionality of the system. Most of the data stored is already considered public anyway since it is available for anyone to see in the blockchain, with the exception of the following:

1. Account settings and preferences
2. Telegram account ID \(only if you are using our [Telegram Bot](features/telegram-bot.md) integration\)
3. Off-chain historical data of investments \(only if you are using the [Time Machine](coming-soon/time-machine.md) and [Binance Exchange Integration](features/binance-exchange-integration.md) functionality at the same time\).

### How long is it stored?

| Data type | Retention |
| :--- | :--- |
| Account settings and preferences | Indefinite We may purge unused accounts after 1 year of inactivity |
| Telegram account ID | Indefinite You can unlink at any time to delete this data forever |
| Off-chain historical data of investments | 3 months |

### How do you use this data?

We only use the stored data to provide you our cool features. No data is ever sold nor used for any additional purpose. We value your privacy!
